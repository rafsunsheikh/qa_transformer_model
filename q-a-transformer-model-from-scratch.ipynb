Error-control codes are applied in various applications, including satellite communication, mobile radio communication, and computer networking.',\n 'Two common methods for error protection are forward error control (FEC) and automatic repeat request (ARQ). In FEC, extra redundant bits are added to protect information bits against errors. In ARQ, redundant bits are used by the receiver to detect errors and request retransmission. FEC requires fewer extra bits to detect errors, while ARQ requires more redundant bits for error detection and correction.',\n 'Forward error control (FEC) involves adding extra redundant bits to the transmitted information. These redundant bits allow the decoder to determine the location and correction of errors that occur during transmission. The advantage of FEC is that it requires fewer extra bits for error detection, making it an efficient method for error protection.',\n 'In automatic repeat request (ARQ), redundant bits are added to the transmitted information for error detection. The receiver uses these bits to detect errors and signals the need for a repeat transmission if errors are detected. ARQ is effective at error detection but requires more redundant bits compared to FEC, as it aims to correct errors as well.',\n 'A repetition code involves sending each data bit multiple times. For example, in a repetition code of block-length three and rate one-third, each data bit is sent three times. The receiver uses a majority vote mechanism to determine the original bit value from the repeated transmissions. This approach increases error resilience, as at least two out of three transmissions must be in error to cause a reception error.',\n 'The Hamming code is an FEC method that adds three redundant bits to a four-bit information signal. A code word consists of seven bits, including four information bits and three redundant bits. The parity bits are chosen to ensure even parity for specific sets of information bits. The Hamming code can correct a single channel error by recalculating parity checks, enhancing error correction in the transmitted signal.',\n \"In block coding, information bits are blocked into finite-length sequences, and redundancy bits are added to create code words. Convolutional encoding, however, doesn't segment encoder output into blocks. It operates as a continuous stream of bits, incorporating memory to determine output based on current and preceding blocks of information bits. Convolutional encoding offers enhanced error-correcting performance but requires a more complex decoding algorithm.\",\n \"In convolutional encoding, memory is used to incorporate previous blocks of information bits along with the current block. This helps determine the encoder's output. The encoder operates by shifting among a finite number of states or nodes, where the current and previous information bits influence the output. More memory states result in better error-correcting performance, but this comes at the cost of a more complex decoding process.\",\n 'Trellis coding is a coding scheme used in high-speed modems. Unlike convolutional encoding, which produces a stream of bits, trellis encoding generates a sequence of modulation symbols. At the transmitter, trellis-coded modulation combines channel encoding with modulation. At the receiver, decoding and demodulation are jointly performed to optimize error correction performance.',\n 'Modulation is the process of varying some characteristic of a carrier wave in accordance with an information signal, or modulating wave. This process is used to represent an information-bearing signal with a waveform that can accurately pass through a transmission medium. The modulated signal is transmitted over a channel and the original information is recovered through demodulation.',\n \"Modulation is necessary for several reasons. Firstly, transmission channels often have limited passbands, passing only certain frequency ranges without significant attenuation. Modulation helps 'fit' information signals to permitted frequency ranges. Secondly, multiple users often share communication channels, requiring each user's signal to be modulated onto an assigned frequency to avoid interference. Modulation also enables practical transmission when the communication channel supports direct transmission, as in the case of using higher frequencies to reduce antenna size.\",\n 'Amplitude modulation (AM) involves varying the amplitude of a fixed-frequency carrier wave proportionally to the information signal. AM is used to modulate analog signals, such as voice, audio, and video signals. It is a technique to encode information onto a carrier wave, making it suitable for transmission over communication channels.',\n 'Frequency modulation (FM) involves varying the frequency of a fixed-amplitude carrier wave based on the information signal. FM is employed to modulate analog signals and is particularly known for its use in FM radio broadcasts. It is utilized to transmit audio and voice signals with improved noise resistance compared to amplitude modulation.',\n \"Digital modulation translates digital data and other digitized information onto an analog carrier wave. This is achieved by modifying the carrier's amplitude, frequency, or phase. Digital modulation is employed to transmit computer data and other digital information over communication channels.\",\n \"Amplitude-shift keying (ASK) is a digital modulation technique that changes the amplitude of a carrier wave to reflect binary data. When transmitting a '1', a burst of radio frequency is sent, and it's stopped for a '0'. ASK can also use a shift between predefined amplitudes to represent '0' and '1'.\",\n \"Frequency-shift keying (FSK) involves changing the frequency of a carrier wave to indicate binary data. In its basic form, two frequencies are used: one for '0' and another for '1'. FSK was used in early voiceband modems for data transmission over telephone networks.\",\n \"Phase-shift keying (PSK) is a digital modulation method where the phase of a carrier wave is altered to convey binary data. Basic PSK uses fixed phases for '0' and '1', such as 0° and 180°. The Bell 212 modem, for instance, employed PSK to transmit data over the public switched telephone network.\",\n \"Multiplexing is used to share a communications channel among multiple users to reduce installation costs. When the channel's capacity exceeds that of a single user, multiplexing methods are employed. These methods involve local combining of signals at a common point to enable effective channel sharing. The two commonly used types of multiplexing are frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) and time-division multiplexing (TDM).\",\n \"Frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) involves sharing a channel by modulating each user's signal onto a different carrier frequency. The modulated signals are combined, and each user is assigned a specific frequency band. FDM is used when the channel's bandwidth allows for multiple users' signals without overlap. It's employed in systems like old long-distance telephone transmission, coaxial cable systems, and point-to-point microwave systems.\",\n \"Time-division multiplexing (TDM) interleaves time segments from different signals onto a single transmission path. This is possible when the channel's data rate is higher than the combined data rates of all users. TDM is applied mainly to digital signals. In TDM, each user's data is presented to a time-division multiplexer, and a scanning switch selects data from each user in sequence to create a composite TDM signal. TDM is widely used in modern telecommunications systems for long-distance transmission.\",\n \"While time-division multiplexing (TDM) can theoretically be applied to analog signals, it's predominantly used for digital signals. TDM involves interleaving segments of different signals, making it more convenient for digital data. TDM systems assume synchronization between data paths, making it easier to combine digital signals in sequence. In practice, TDM is primarily employed for digital transmission in modern telecommunications.\",\n \"Frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) involves modulating users' signals onto different carrier frequencies. These modulated signals are combined into a complex group signal. To avoid signal overlap, guard bands of unused frequency spectrum are inserted between modulated signals. FDM forms a hierarchy of signal combinations, increasing bandwidth and voice-carrying capacity.\",\n \"In time-division multiplexing (TDM), data from multiple users are interleaved onto a single transmission path. A scanning switch selects data from each user in sequence, forming a composite TDM signal. Users' data paths must be time-aligned and synchronized with the scanning mechanism. TDM assigns specific time slots to each user, and the switch advances to select different time slots, thereby ensuring separation of data.\",\n 'Three schemes are used for efficient sharing of a single channel in telecommunications: frequency-division multiple access (FDMA), time-division multiple access (TDMA), and code-division multiple access (CDMA). These techniques can be used alone or in combination, and they are well demonstrated by advanced mobile cellular systems.',\n 'FDMA divides the frequency spectrum into slots, and signals of different users are placed in separate frequency slots. Since the frequency spectrum is limited and there are more users than available slots, efficient slot management is essential. In systems like the advanced mobile phone system (AMPS), callers use separate frequency slots. Released slots are reassigned by a network-managing computer at the cellular base station. AMPS aims to reuse frequency slots to accommodate more callers by reassigning slots within cells and allowing simultaneous use in different cells.',\n \"In TDMA, time is divided into slots, and users' signals are placed in separate time slots. Random requests for slots can lead to situations where the number of requests exceeds available slots. In such cases, data needs to be buffered until slots become available. The IS54 cellular system employs TDMA to interleave three digital signals, transmitting them in a 30-kilohertz frequency slot that would be occupied by one analog signal in AMPS. Although buffering introduces some delay, it's usually not noticeable during a call.\",\n 'In CDMA, signals are sent simultaneously in the same frequency band. Receivers select or reject signals based on user-specific signature waveforms created from assigned spreading codes. The IS95 cellular system uses CDMA, where analog speech signals are quantized, organized into digital frames, and then encoded. Interleaved data bits determine which of 64 possible waveforms to transmit, each with a specific polarity pattern. The waveform is spread using a code sequence, occupying a larger bandwidth.',\n 'CDMA sends signals simultaneously in the same frequency band and uses signature waveforms to differentiate users. Unlike FDMA, which assigns separate frequency slots, and TDMA, which divides time into slots, CDMA uses spreading codes to separate signals at the receiver based on their unique code sequence. This spread-spectrum multiple access (SSMA) technique eliminates the need for frequency management found in FDMA.',\n \"Telecommunication is the transmission of information using technologies like wire, radio, optical, or electromagnetic systems. It originated from humans' desire for communication over longer distances than the human voice could cover efficiently. Slow systems like postal mail are excluded. The goal was to achieve expediency in communication over longer distances.\",\n 'Transmission media in telecommunication have evolved through various technological stages. This evolution includes visual signals like beacons, smoke signals, semaphore telegraphs, signal flags, and optical heliographs. It also involves electrical cable and electromagnetic radiation, including light. Communication paths are often divided into channels that enable multiplexing multiple concurrent communication sessions.',\n 'Examples of pre-modern long-distance communication methods include coded drumbeats, lung-blown horns, and loud whistles. These audio messages were used to transmit information over distances. However, the 20th and 21st centuries saw advancements in electrical and electromagnetic technologies like telegraph, telephone, television, radio, microwave transmission, optical fiber, and communications satellites.',\n 'Pioneering inventors and developers in the field of electrical and electronic telecommunications include Guglielmo Marconi, Charles Wheatstone, Samuel Morse (telegraph inventors), Antonio Meucci, Alexander Graham Bell (telephone inventors), Edwin Armstrong, Lee de Forest (radio inventors), and Vladimir K. Zworykin, John Logie Baird, Philo Farnsworth (television inventors).',\n 'With the rise of digital technologies since the 1960s, data has become a supplement to voice communication. Metallic data transmission limitations led to the development of optical technologies. The development of media-independent Internet technologies has provided worldwide access to services without location or time restrictions.',\n \"Telecommunication is a compound noun originating from the Greek prefix tele- (τῆλε), meaning distant or far off, and the Latin verb communicare, meaning to share. The modern use of the term is adapted from the French language. The term was first recorded in written form in 1904 by the French engineer and novelist Édouard Estaunié. The word 'communication' itself was first used in the English language in the late 14th century. It was derived from Old French 'comunicacion' (14th century, Modern French communication), which comes from Latin 'communicationem,' the noun of action from the past participle stem of 'communicare,' meaning 'to share, divide out; communicate, impart, inform; join, unite, participate in,' and literally, 'to make common,' from 'communis.'\",\n 'At the 1932 Plenipotentiary Telegraph Conference and the International Radiotelegraph Conference in Madrid, the two organizations merged to form the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).',\n \"They defined telecommunication as 'any telegraphic or telephonic communication of signs, signals, writing, facsimiles and sounds of any kind, by wire, wireless or other systems or processes of electric signaling or visual signaling (semaphores).' The definition was later reconfirmed, according to Article 1.3 of the ITU Radio Regulations, which defined it as 'Any transmission, emission or reception of signs, signals, writings, images and sounds or intelligence of any nature by wire, radio, optical, or other electromagnetic systems.'\",\n 'Homing pigeons have been used throughout history by different cultures. Pigeon post had Persian roots and was later used by the Romans to aid their military. Frontinus claimed Julius Caesar used pigeons as messengers in his conquest of Gaul. The Greeks also conveyed the names of the victors at the Olympic Games to various cities using homing pigeons. In the early 19th century, the Dutch government used the system in Java and Sumatra. And in 1849, Paul Julius Reuter started a pigeon service to fly stock prices between Aachen and Brussels, a service that operated for a year until the gap in the telegraph link was closed.',\n \"In the Middle Ages, chains of beacons were commonly used on hilltops as a means of relaying a signal. Beacon chains suffered the drawback that they could only pass a single bit of information, so the meaning of the message such as 'the enemy has been sighted' had to be agreed upon in advance. One notable instance of their use was during the Spanish Armada, when a beacon chain relayed a signal from Plymouth to London.\",\n 'In 1792, Claude Chappe, a French engineer, built the first fixed visual telegraphy system (or semaphore line) between Lille and Paris. However semaphore suffered from the need for skilled operators and expensive towers at intervals of ten to thirty kilometres (six to nineteen miles). As a result of competition from the electrical telegraph, the last commercial line was abandoned in 1880.',\n \"On July 25, 1837, the first commercial electrical telegraph was demonstrated by English inventor Sir William Fothergill Cooke and English scientist Sir Charles Wheatstone. Both inventors viewed their device as 'an improvement to the [existing] electromagnetic telegraph' and not as a new device.\",\n \"Samuel Morse independently developed a version of the electrical telegraph that he unsuccessfully demonstrated on September 2, 1837.

This can be reduced, but not eliminated, only at the expense of increasing the channel bandwidth requirement.',\n \"The term 'channel' has two different meanings. In one meaning, a channel is the physical medium that carries a signal between the transmitter and the receiver. The other meaning of the term 'channel' in telecommunications is seen in the phrase communications channel, which is a subdivision of a transmission medium so that it can be used to send multiple streams of information simultaneously.\",\n 'Examples of physical mediums that carry a signal between the transmitter and the receiver include the atmosphere for sound communications, glass optical fibers for some kinds of optical communications, coaxial cables for communications using voltages and electric currents, and free space for communications using visible light, infrared waves, ultraviolet light, and radio waves.',\n \"In the example above, the 'free space channel' has been divided into communications channels according to frequencies, and each channel is assigned a separate frequency bandwidth in which to broadcast radio waves. This system of dividing the medium into channels according to frequency is called 'frequency-division multiplexing'.\",\n \"Another way of dividing a communications medium into channels is to allocate each sender a recurring segment of time (a 'time slot'), and to allow each sender to send messages only within its own time slot.

This move is made possible by the production of cheaper, faster and more capable integrated circuits. The chief advantage of digital broadcasts is that they prevent a number of complaints common to traditional analog broadcasts. For television, this includes the elimination of problems such as snowy pictures, ghosting and other distortion. These occur because of the nature of analog transmission, which means that perturbations due to noise will be evident in the final output. Digital transmission overcomes this problem because digital signals are reduced to discrete values upon reception and hence small perturbations do not affect the final output. In a simplified example, if a binary message 1011 was transmitted with signal amplitudes [1.0 0.0 1.0 1.0] and received with signal amplitudes [0.9 0.2 1.1 0.9] it would still decode to the binary message 1011— a perfect reproduction of what was sent. From this example, a problem with digital transmissions can also be seen in that if the noise is great enough it can significantly alter the decoded message. Using forward error correction a receiver can correct a handful of bit errors in the resulting message but too much noise will lead to incomprehensible output and hence a breakdown of the transmission.',\n 'In digital television broadcasting, there are three competing standards that are likely to be adopted worldwide. These are the ATSC, DVB and ISDB standards; the adoption of these standards thus far is presented in the captioned map. All three standards use MPEG-2 for video compression.

The exception is the United States which has chosen to adopt HD Radio. HD Radio, unlike Eureka 147, is based upon a transmission method known as in-band on-channel transmission that allows digital information to 'piggyback' on normal AM or FM analog transmissions.\",\n 'However, despite the pending switch to digital, analog television remains being transmitted in most countries. An exception is the United States that ended analog television transmission (by all but the very low-power TV stations) on 12 June 2009 after twice delaying the switchover deadline.

These are known as PAL (German designed), NTSC (American designed), and SECAM (French-designed). For analog radio, the switch to digital radio is made more difficult by the higher cost of digital receivers. The choice of modulation for analog radio is typically between amplitude (AM) or frequency modulation (FM). To achieve stereo playback, an amplitude modulated subcarrier is used for stereo FM, and quadrature amplitude modulation is used for stereo AM or C-QUAM.',\n 'The Internet works in part because of protocols that govern how the computers and routers communicate with each other. The nature of computer network communication lends itself to a layered approach where individual protocols in the protocol stack run more-or-less independently of other protocols. This allows lower-level protocols to be customized for the network situation while not changing the way higher-level protocols operate.

Additional technologies, such as DHCP, allowed TCP/IP-based computers to self-configure in the network. Such functions also existed in the AppleTalk/ IPX/ NetBIOS protocol sets.',\n 'Whereas Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) or Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) are typical data-link protocols for larger networks such as WANs; Ethernet and Token Ring are typical data-link protocols for LANs. These protocols differ from the former protocols in that they are simpler, e.g., they omit features such as quality of service guarantees, and offer medium access control. Both of these differences allow for more economical systems.',\n 'Despite the modest popularity of Token Ring in the 1980s and 1990s, virtually all LANs now use either wired or wireless Ethernet facilities. At the physical layer, most wired Ethernet implementations use copper twisted-pair cables (including the common 10BASE-T networks). However, some early implementations used heavier coaxial cables and some recent implementations (especially high-speed ones) use optical fibers. When optic fibers are used, the distinction must be made between multimode fibers and single-mode fibers. Multimode fibers can be thought of as thicker optical fibers that are cheaper to manufacture devices for, but that suffer from less usable bandwidth and worse attenuation—implying poorer long-distance performance.',\n 'A telecommunications network is a group of nodes interconnected by telecommunications links that are used to exchange messages between the nodes. The links may use a variety of technologies based on the methodologies of circuit switching, message switching, or packet switching, to pass messages and signals.',\n \"In general, every telecommunications network conceptually consists of three parts, or planes (so-called because they can be thought of as being and often are, separate overlay networks):\\n\\n- The data plane (also user plane, bearer plane, or forwarding plane) carries the network's users' traffic, the actual payload.\\n- The control plane carries control information (also known as signaling).\\n- The management plane carries the operations, administration and management traffic required for network management. The management plane is sometimes considered a part of the control plane.\",\n 'Examples of telecommunications networks include computer networks, the Internet, the public switched telephone network (PSTN), the global Telex network, the aeronautical ACARS network, and the wireless radio networks of cell phone telecommunication providers.',\n 'There are three features that differentiate MANs from LANs or WANs:\\n\\n- The area of the network size is between LANs and WANs. The MAN will have a physical area between 5 and 50 km in diameter.\\n- MANs do not generally belong to a single organization. The equipment that interconnects the network, the links, and the MAN itself are often owned by an association or a network provider that provides or leases the service to others.\\n- A MAN is a means for sharing resources at high speeds within the network. It often provides connections to WAN networks for access to resources outside the scope of the MAN.',\n \"In analogy to the improvements in the speed and capacity of digital computers, provided by advances in semiconductor technology and expressed in the bi-yearly doubling of transistor density, which is described empirically by Moore's law, the capacity and speed of telecommunications networks have followed similar advances, for similar reasons. In telecommunication, this is expressed in Edholm's law, proposed by and named after Phil Edholm in 2004. This empirical law holds that the bandwidth of telecommunication networks doubles every 18 months, which has proven to be true since the 1970s. The trend is evident in the Internet, cellular (mobile), wireless and wired local area networks (LANs), and personal area networks.\",\n 'A computer network is a set of computers sharing resources located on or provided by network nodes. Computers use common communication protocols over digital interconnections to communicate with each other. These interconnections are made up of telecommunication network technologies based on physically wired, optical, and wireless radio-frequency methods that may be arranged in a variety of network topologies.',\n 'The nodes of a computer network can include personal computers, servers, networking hardware, or other specialized or general-purpose hosts. They are identified by network addresses and may have hostnames. Hostnames serve as memorable labels for the nodes and are rarely changed after initial assignment. Network addresses serve for locating and identifying the nodes by communication protocols such as the Internet Protocol.',\n 'Computer networking was influenced by a wide array of technology developments and historical milestones:\\n\\n- In the late 1950s, a network of computers was built for the U.S. military Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) radar system using the Bell 101 modem.\\n- In 1959, Christopher Strachey filed a patent application for time-sharing and John McCarthy initiated the first project to implement time-sharing of user programs at MIT.\\n- In 1959, Anatoly Kitov proposed a network of computing centers for the Soviet armed forces and economy.\\n- In 1960, the SABRE airline reservation system went online with connected mainframes.\\n- In 1963, J.

A network allows sharing of network and computing resources. Users may access and use resources provided by devices on the network, such as printing a document on a shared network printer or use of a shared storage device. A network allows sharing of files, data, and other types of information giving authorized users the ability to access information stored on other computers on the network. Distributed computing uses computing resources across a network to accomplish tasks.',\n 'Most modern computer networks use protocols based on packet-mode transmission. A network packet is a formatted unit of data carried by a packet-switched network. Packets consist of two types of data: control information and user data (payload). The control information provides data the network needs to deliver the user data, for example, source and destination network addresses, error detection codes, and sequencing information. Typically, control information is found in packet headers and trailers, with payload data in between.\\n\\nWith packets, the bandwidth of the transmission medium can be better shared among users than if the network were circuit switched. When one user is not sending packets, the link can be filled with packets from other users, and so the cost can be shared, with relatively little interference, provided the link is not overused. Often the route a packet needs to take through a network is not immediately available. In that case, the packet is queued and waits until a link is free.\\n\\nThe physical link technologies of packet networks typically limit the size of packets to a certain maximum transmission unit (MTU). A longer message may be fragmented before it is transferred and once the packets arrive, they are reassembled to construct the original message.',\n 'The physical or geographic locations of network nodes and links generally have relatively little effect on a network, but the topology of interconnections of a network can significantly affect its throughput and reliability. With many technologies, such as bus or star networks, a single failure can cause the network to fail entirely. In general, the more interconnections there are, the more robust the network is; but the more expensive it is to install. Therefore, most network diagrams are arranged by their network topology which is the map of logical interconnections of network hosts.',\n 'Common topologies are:\\n\\n    - Bus network: all nodes are connected to a common medium along this medium.\\n    - Star network: all nodes are connected to a special central node.\\n    - Ring network: each node is connected to its left and right neighbor node.\\n    - Mesh network: each node is connected to an arbitrary number of neighbors.\\n    - Fully connected network: each node is connected to every other node.\\n    - Tree network: nodes are arranged hierarchically.\\n\\nThe physical layout of the nodes in a network may not necessarily reflect the network topology. As an example, with FDDI, the network topology is a ring, but the physical topology is often a star, because all neighboring connections can be routed via a central physical location.',\n 'An overlay network is a virtual network built on top of another network. Nodes in the overlay network are connected by virtual links that correspond to paths in the underlying network. The topology of the overlay network may differ from the underlying one. For example, many peer-to-peer networks are overlay networks. The Internet itself is a prominent example of an overlay network, built on top of the telephone network. Overlay networks have been proposed to improve Internet routing and quality of service, often without requiring modifications to all routers in the network.',\n \"The transmission media used to link devices in a computer network include electrical cable, optical fiber, and free space.

It's utilized in long-distance telephone transmission, coaxial cable systems, and point-to-point microwave systems.\",\n \"Time-division multiplexing (TDM) interleaves time segments from different signals onto a single transmission path. It's feasible when the channel's data rate exceeds the combined user data rates. TDM is mainly applied to digital signals.

It's used to manage communication in systems like the advanced mobile phone system (AMPS), where separate frequency slots are assigned to callers. Reassigned frequency slots within cells and simultaneous use in separate cells help accommodate more callers.\",\n \"Time-division multiple access (TDMA) divides time into slots for users' signals. Random slot requests can lead to situations where requests exceed available slots, requiring data buffering. In the IS54 cellular system, TDMA interleaves three digital signals in a 30-kilohertz frequency slot, buffering data to manage delays introduced by buffering.\",\n \"Code-division multiple access (CDMA) involves sending signals simultaneously in the same frequency band. Receivers distinguish signals using user-specific signature waveforms generated from spreading codes. The IS95 cellular system utilizes CDMA, quantizing analog speech signals, organizing them into digital frames, and encoding them. Interleaved data bits select from 64 possible waveforms, each with a unique polarity pattern. The waveform is spread using a code sequence, spreading the signal's power over a wider bandwidth.\",\n 'CDMA distinguishes itself by sending signals simultaneously in the same frequency band and using user-specific signature waveforms. Unlike FDMA and TDMA, which rely on frequency or time slot separation, CDMA employs spreading codes to separate signals at the receiver.
